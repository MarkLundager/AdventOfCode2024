# To run locally on machine:

1. git clone the repository to desired location.
2. create config.h file in repository at root directory
3. add the line "#define SESSIONID [you're advent of code sessionid]" this allows for automatic retrieval of your personal input. Don't share your sessionid accidentally by forgetting to add config.h in gitignore...
4. run make && make test
